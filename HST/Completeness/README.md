# SKYSURF Completeness GUI

To use the SKYSURF Completeness GUI, simply run

```
python completeness_calculator_gui.py
```

Requirements: PyQt5 and sys packages

When the GUI loads, you should get a set of forms to fill out. The two drop down menus determine which csv files the code will draw from.
The last three consist of parameters to fill out to get the completeness at that point. 
A good example is using size of 1", 1000 seconds of exposure time, and 0.1 for background. The 50% completeness magnitude is displayed below.
