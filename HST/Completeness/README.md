# SKYSURF Completeness GUI

To use the SKYSURF Completeness GUI, you need to have the PyQt5 and sys packages installed.

To run the GUI, simply type "python completeness_calculator_gui.py" into your terminal.

When the GUI loads, you will get a set of forms to fill out. Specify the camera, filter, object size (in arcsec), background lebel (in counts per second), and exposure time (in sec). A good example is using size of 1", 1000 seconds of exposure time, and 0.1 for background. The 50% completeness AB-magnitude is displayed after clicking "Calculuate".
