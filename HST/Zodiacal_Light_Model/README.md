# SKYSURF Zodiacal Light Model

This is an IDL model of the SKYSURF Zodiacal Light model (see O'Brien et al. 2025). Please refer to run_model.pro for example usage.

To run:
'''
zodi_intensity = get_zmod(wavelength,"skysurf",day,lon,lat)
'''

It can also be run in the original Kelsall et al. 1998 mode:
'''
zodi_intensity = get_zmod(wavelength,"skysurf",day,lon,lat)
'''

Inputs:
	lambda     - [float] wavelength in microns
	phase_type - [str] "kelsall" or "skysurf"
				Whether to use the standard Kelsall+1998 phase function 
				or the O'Brien+2025 phase function. To use the Kelsall 
				phase function, the wavelength must be one of DIRBE's 
				nominal wavelengths: 1.25, 2.2, 3.5, 4.9, 12, 25, 60, 
				100, 140, 240
	day        - [arr] 1990 day number(s), where 1.0 = 1 Jan 1990
	lon        - [arr] ecliptic longitude(s)
	lat        - [arr] ecliptic latitude(s)

	note: lambda, day, lon, lat can be any mixture of scalars or arrays, 
           but all arrays must be of same length.

Outputs:

	zodi - scalar or array of zodi model intensity in MJy sr-1
				For comparison with DIRBE data, this is 'quoted' intensity
				at the nominal wavelength(s) for an assumed source
				spectrum nu*F_nu = constant

Optional Keyword Inputs:

	zpar=zpar - array of zodi model params.  If not specified, the
				default will be restored from zpars.xdr
	solar_irr - [float] solar irradiance (in MJy/sr) corresponding to a 
				bandpass


This model was written so that it can work between wavelengths 0.2--4.9 microns. 

The SKYSURF model is only reliable at:
	- wavelengths between 0.2 and 2.7 microns.
	- Sun angles greater than 80 deg.
