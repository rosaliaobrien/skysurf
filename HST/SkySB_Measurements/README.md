# SKYSURF Sky-SB Estimation Algorithm

These codes are used to estimate the sky surface brightness from an image. Please refer 
to [O'Brien et al. (2022)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv221008010O/abstract) for details on the
algorithm. The Jupyter Notebook shows how to run these codes on some test data. 

These codes work with Python 3, up to version<=3.9. Refer to [requirements.txt](https://github.com/rosaliaobrien/skysurf/blob/main/HST/requirements.txt) for specific package versions that were used when this code was created.
