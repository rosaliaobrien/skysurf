# SKYSURF

The [SKYSURF Project](http://skysurf.asu.edu) uses Hubble's remarkable precision and stability to measure the absolute all-sky surface brightness in the 0.2-1.7 micron wavebands from over 200,000 images. This project is now succeeded by SKYSURF-IR: a JWST Cy program to do the same thing. This GitHub repository hosts various codes used for these projects.

Refer to the HST folder for codes related to SKYSURF. It includes SKYSURF algorithms to measure the sky-SB and a galaxy completeness GUI for HST predictions.

The SKYSURF team continues to analyze SKYSURF images. Here is a list of current publications:
