# SKYSURF

The [SKYSURF Project](http://skysurf.asu.edu) uses Hubble's remarkable precision and stability to measure the absolute all-sky surface brightness in the 0.2-1.7 micron wavebands from over 200,000 images. This project is now succeeded by SKYSURF-IR: a JWST Cy program to do the same thing. This GitHub repository hosts various codes used for these projects.

The SKYSURF team continues to analyze SKYSURF images. Here is a list of current publications:
